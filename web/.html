<h2>Get on a good schedule</h2>

We need structure and routine in our lives.  Our bodies expect it.
They perform best when we operate on a regular schedule.
We especially need to eat and sleep about the same time each day.
This routine stays with a person their whole life and helps them to 
develop good work habits.</p>

<h2>Eat a healthy diet</h2>

Our brains need the right food to perform at their peak.
Don’t go to school or work on an empty stomach.
Students need to train themselves early to eat a balanced and healthy diet.</p>

<h2>Learn to exercise</h2>
<p>We need physical activity to stay healthy.
The benefits of regular exercise are well documented.
We need to find exercise routines that are fun and match our individual tastes..</p>

<h2>Never give up</h2>
<p>I remember being told in school that,
"Winners never quit and quitters never win."
These sayings come back to me time and again when I feel like giving up.
